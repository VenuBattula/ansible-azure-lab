If C(remote_src=yes), path on the target server to existing archive file to unpack.,If C(remote_src=yes) and C(src) contains C(://), the remote machine will download the file from the URL first. (version_added 2.0). This is only for simple cases, for full download support use the M(get_url) module.
    remote_src: yes # not required. Set to C(yes) to indicate the archived file is already on the remote system and not local to the Ansible controller.,This option is mutually exclusive with C(copy).
